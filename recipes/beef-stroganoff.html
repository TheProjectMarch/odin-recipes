  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>Beef Stroganoff or Beef Stroganov is a Russian dish of sautéed pieces of beef served in a sauce with smetana. From its origins in mid-19th-century Russia, it has become popular around the world, with considerable variation from the original recipe.</p>
  <p>This is a fairly lean version of beef stroganoff, as most recipes call for more cream. This is something you can easily adjust to your tastes. I like a little thicker version, with just enough sauce to coat the meat and noodles.</p>

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 pounds beef chuck roast, cut into 1/2-inch thick strips</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>½ medium onion, sliced or diced</li>
    <li>8 ounces sliced mushrooms</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ cup white wine</li>
    <li>2 cups beef broth, divided</li>
    <li>¾ cup creme fraiche</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh chopped chives</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Season beef generously with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until nearly smoking. Stir in beef; cook, stirring constantly, for 6-7 minutes, until liquid evaporates and meat browns. Remove meat from the pan and set aside.</li>
    <li>Stir butter, mushrooms and onions into the pan; cook and stir over medium heat until the vegetables are lightly browned. Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Stir in flour; cook for 1-2 minutes until incorporated.</li>
    <li>Stir in wine and 1 cup of stock, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits. Bring to a simmer, cook for 3-4 minutes, until the sauce thickens.</li>
    <li>Return beef to the pan. Stir in remaining cup of stock; bring to a simmer and cook on low heat for about 1 hour with the lid on, until the beef is tender and the sauce is thick. Stir every 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in creme fraiche. Stir in chives. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
  </ol>
